## Project Summary

During my work at DigDash, I built an Urban Agenda Observatory dashboard for the Cartagena City Council. The dashboard is directly embedded in the City Council's website: It presents the administration's progress on each defined strategic objective. City council teams update the data autonomously through simple forms.

## What was accomplished in this project

### Web Dashboard
- **Corporate design**: Dashboard adapted to the website theme for perfect integration
- **Mobile version**: Dashboard delivered in responsive mode for optimal use on both mobile and desktop
- **Embedded**: Dashboards embedded directly in the City Council's website
- **D3.js**: Inclusion of various charts developed with D3.js

### Data Management
- **ETL process**: Automated data extraction
- **Data quality**: Application of data management and transformation rules
- **Autonomous update**: Development of data update forms to allow autonomous data updates for non-technical profiles

### Implementation
- **Implementation**: Deployment of the development on the administration's on-premise server
- **Documentation**: Writing of user manuals, Delivery of architecture and implementation documents
