## Project Summary

Completed during my work at DigDash, this project involved developing an embedded dashboard that provides daily updated key indicators on the evolution of COVID-19 in France and worldwide. It integrates figures such as incidence, hospitalization, mortality, vaccination, variants, and contact tracing, and allows filtering by region or age group through interactive maps and charts. It is embedded in the French public health agency's website (Sant√© Publique France).

## What was accomplished in this project

### Data Management
- **Multiple data sources**: inclusion of data sources such as APIs, Excel and CSV files, SQL databases
- **Data quality**: application of data selection and transformation rules
- **Semantic layer**: definition of the semantic layer in data models, including: data hierarchy, formats, objectives, translations, etc.
- **Advanced calculated measures**: measures to calculate moving average percentages, prediction, trends, etc.

### Dashboard Development
- **Responsive**: Dashboard available in desktop and mobile mode
- **Translated**: In English and French
- **Corporate design**: Customization of dashboard pages to perfectly fit the administration's website
- **High audience**: More than 80,000 simultaneous connections, so a specific architecture was implemented to support the high volume of visits
- **Validation**: Test protocols to validate presented dashboards

### Project Management
- **Planning follow-up**: Progress meetings with client teams, with the objective of respecting the defined planning
- **Documentation**: Validation reports, usage reports, technical documentation

### Automated PDF Reports
- **Customized**: Design aligned with the website and dashboard
- **Approval cycle**: so that Administration teams can validate the report before its distribution
