## About Me

I am a developer with over 7 years of experience in data visualization, business intelligence, and web development. During my BI Consultant experience at DigDash in Madrid, I specialized in creating interactive dashboards, data pipelines, and custom BI solutions.

With a strong background in both front-end and back-end development, I have successfully delivered projects for SMEs, large corporations, and government administrations. My expertise spans from data analysis and visualization to full-stack web development, with a particular focus on creating user-friendly, data-driven applications.

My goal is to continue developing innovative solutions that transform complex data into actionable insights for businesses and organizations.

As a Freelance, I can help you : 
- develop your web, iOS or Android application
- create dashboard with DigDash, Power BI or Metabase
- analyze data and extract hidden insight fron it
- integrate APIs to your stack
